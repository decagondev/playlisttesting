## Mastery Task 6: Create an API Gateway

Right now we have 5 different Lambda functions that
are responsible for the REST API methods we'd like our
users to have access to. That's great but not very 
useable.

What we'd like now is to build a Gateway on AWS that
maps HTTP requests to lambda functions. Refer to the
[Design Document](../../DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md) for specific
end points.

We will build this together during our final guided project.
